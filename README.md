Hi there! 👋 I’m Wanxinan  

**👀 Interests:**  
C/C++ • Linux • System Programming • Audio/Video Development • 3D Game Engines • Embedded Systems  

**🌱 Currently Learning:**  
- Audio/video codecs (H.264/H.265, AAC) and streaming protocols (RTMP/RTSP/WebRTC)  
- 3D computer graphics (OpenGL/Vulkan) and game engine development (e.g., lightweight engine from scratch)  
- Linux kernel driver development (focus on multimedia device drivers)  
- High-performance C++ framework design for real-time rendering and low-latency audio/video processing  

**💞 Looking to Collaborate On:**  
- **Audio/Video Projects**:  
  - Real-time audio/video communication systems (e.g., video conferencing, live streaming platforms)  
  - Cross-platform media player development (supporting hardware decoding)  
  - Audio signal processing algorithms (noise cancellation, echo cancellation)  
- **3D Game/Graphcis Projects**:  
  - Lightweight 3D game development (using OpenGL ES/Vulkan)  
  - Terrain rendering, physics engine integration (e.g., Bullet Physics)  
  - Cross-platform graphics rendering frameworks (Windows/Linux/Embedded)  
- **Embedded & System-Level Projects**:  
  - Linux-based smart device development (e.g., audio/video terminals, gaming handhelds)  
  - Heterogeneous computing acceleration (GPU/NNN for audio/video/graphics tasks)
